<h1>Bungee Mining:<br/> Take the Plunge!</h1>

<p>
Bungee mining is a new approach to interactive data mining and visualization proposed by the creators of Reactive Search Optimization (RSO).
</p>
<p>
Until recently, the job of analyzing data to produce useful business intelligence has been complex, slow and tedious. You had to rely on IT services to obtain data in the way you needed for your decisions and the analysis took time and patience and produced stress. 
</p>
<p>
Not anymore with our &quot;Bungee Mining&quot; approach: jump into your data and fly towards your goal, in full safety and control. 
</p>
<p>
Bungee Mining hints at extreme programming and agile software development, but it actually advocates a less extreme approach. The elastic bungee cord connecting the jumper to the platform corresponds to new methods which guarantee convergence to a useful solution even in a rapidly changing context, such as where the developer must react quickly to customer feedback and other dynamic environments.
