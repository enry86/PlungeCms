 Bungee mining is a new approach to interactive data mining and visualization proposed by the creators of Reactive Search Optimization (RSO).
</p><p>
Until recently, the job of analyzing data to produce useful business intelligence has been complex, slow and tedious. ]] You had to rely on IT services to obtain data in the way you needed for your decisions and the analysis took time and patience and produced stress. 
</p><p>
Not anymore with our “Bungee Mining” approach: jump into your data and fly towards your goal, in full safety and control. 
</p><p>
Bungee Mining hints at extreme programming and agile software development, but it actually advocates a less extreme approach. The elastic bungee cord connecting the jumper to the platform corresponds to new methods which guarantee convergence to a useful solution even in a rapidly changing context, such as where the developer must react quickly to customer feedback and other dynamic environments.
</p><p>
There are two phases to the Bungee Mining approach: the first phase - the jump - is characterized by a rapid exploration of the data, intellectual courage, and a sense of freedom, exploration and creativity. The last phase - the elastic oscillations -  is characterized by rapid adaptation of the first results to more detailed constraints and final user requirements, with possible quick trajectory changes, but with methods ensuring rapid convergence to the final objective and to the exploitation of the obtained insight.  
</p><p>
Methods to achieve these objectives are based on interaction, mutual learning and feedback loops – both from the decision maker to the software system and from the software system to the decision maker. The end user discovers possibilities and may change his objectives after the first results are available. The system saves the user’s judgments and responses and uses them in an optimal way to focus his search more and more towards his real preferences.
A quick reaction based on a sound machine learning approach is coupled to proactive actions to prepare for changes, measure progress and come progressively closer to the target.
