No actual programming is required for many basic application scenarios, when performance measures and objectives are already available, apart from connecting the data mining and visualization routines to the data and the performance measures. This activity is usually rapid and seamless, provided that modern tools, programming languages and databases have been used in the system modeling and data collection tasks. The Bungee Mining team is available for suggestions about how the approach can be deployed for your application case.
