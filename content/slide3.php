<h3>From data to insight through Reactive Search Optimization techniques</h3> 
</div>
<div class="text">
<p>
In business, technical and scientific processes, the raw data are only the
starting point for any investigation, design or problem solving effort.
Real insight can be obtained only through models intended to
&quot;explain&quot; the
raw data in a concise and summarized manner. This requires a spiraling
process where models are identified, learnt, validated or improved though
various feedback paths involving the designer or careful tests with
additional data if appropriates. 
This &quot;on the job learning&quot; method is at the foundation of
Reactive Search Optimization, advocating learning loops to improve the
results while a system is working on a specific case. Automation is
increased by the use  of adaptation  and machine learning  schemes during
the iterations, relieving the end user from the expensive and slow tuning
process required for solving the case of interest. When translated into
human terms, RSO coupled with Bungee Mining works according to the
following principles:
Free your mind from software complications (detailed choices, tuning,
etc.)  and concentrate your creativity on  exploring relationships in your
data, on specifying your preferences, and on designing your preferred
solution.
Do not concentrate on the tools and the technologies, but let your preferences and insight come into the spotlight.  
Navigate in the solution space to identify interesting patterns and
promising alternatives, focus onto the most interesting parts of the data
space, build a mental map of the possibilities.
Build models to predict the output for new cases, visualize how the various input data influence the output. 
Develop trailblazing dynamic visualizations that go beyond the standard and static plots.
