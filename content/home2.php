<h3>What is Bungee Mining?</h3>
</div>
<div class="text">
<p>
There are two phases to the Bungee Mining approach: the first phase - the jump - is characterized by a rapid exploration of the data, intellectual courage, and a sense of freedom, exploration and creativity. The last phase - the elastic oscillations -  is characterized by rapid adaptation of the first results to more detailed constraints and final user requirements, with possible quick trajectory changes, but with methods ensuring rapid convergence to the final objective and to the exploitation of the obtained insight.  
</p><p>
Methods to achieve these objectives are based on interaction, mutual
learning and feedback loops both from the decision maker to the software
system and from the software system to the decision maker. The end user
discovers possibilities and may change his objectives after the first
results are available. The system saves the user's judgments and responses and uses them in an optimal way to focus his search more and more towards his real preferences.
A quick reaction based on a sound machine learning approach is coupled to proactive actions to prepare for changes, measure progress and come progressively closer to the target.
